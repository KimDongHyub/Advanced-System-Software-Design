using g++ compiler, made binary file named 'inverter' using this command. -> g++ DongHyubKim.cpp  -o inverter

run this code in terminal using command -> ./inverter inputs.txt

below picture is capture of result. result could be little bit different from pdf's result. because I changed contents of txt files inside(to test words like t2is). and for inputs.txt I left first line blank. to see whether it makes error or not. that's why index starts with 1, not 0 -> didn't make error .
